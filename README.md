# Colombia GAM Casestudy

Previous literature shows that energy performs better under non-linear modelling approaches. The usual approaches are either nonparametric methodologies like Splines, Support Vector Machine (machine learning methodologies in general), or fully parametric methodologies as Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), a consistently found but overly simplified approach from GLMs is Linear Regression. From a statistical point of view even when fully parametric methodologies are more desirable due to its high interpretability, they often perform poorly for not being able to capture the non-linear effects of the covariates over the response leading to higher errors, on the other hand, nonparametric methodologies like Machine learning have the lowest errors but tend to be looked down on because they are considered to be black box models that are highly flexible but outside of the user control for being fully automatic.  This is where the Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) come into play as an appealing alternative due to their semi-parametric nature by being an extension of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) that can fit both parametric and non-parametric relationships through smoothing. Furthermore, the smoothing component allows them to account for the spatial varying effects of covariates over the response. In this case instead of using a Kernel as in SVM for modelling the spatially correlated covariates a two-dimensional discrete (Markov Random Fields) smoother is used. This reporsitory holds the methodology, code and files from Colombian data used to apply second-generation GAMs to model spatial-temporal energy data with one-dimensional smoothers: Cyclic and Non-Cyclic Cubic Splines and two-dimensional smoothers: Markov Random Fields and Tensor Splines Interactions.
